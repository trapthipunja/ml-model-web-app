# Deploying a deep learning model on web (ml-model-web-app)

This repository is to get a hands-on approach to deploy machine learning and deep learning models on web using flask and python.

### Workflow 

  - Train a deep learning network on local machine
  - Wrap the inference model with a Flask application
  - Deploy on a cloud application platform such as GCP, AWS or Heroku
